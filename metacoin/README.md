## Sending Ether

Note that the amount of ETH to send has to be a string not an integer.

For this to work, the recipient has to have a receive() function.

```
w = web3.utils.toWei("1","ether")
coin.send(w)
```

To send the same amount of ETH to a payable function, you pass the ETH as the last parameter.

```
coin.sendCashToThisContract({value: w})
```

There are four parameters you can add when sending the ETH. `gas` and `gasPrice` have minimum values set by the EVM.

```
coin.sendCashToThisContract({value: w, from: accounts[1], gasPrice: "140970877", gas: "1000000"})
```


Get the balance of the contract:

```
balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(coin1.address)
```

Get the balance of one of the 10 built in accounts:

```
balance = await web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0])
```

Assuming the contract was deployed from a different account, this will try to withdraw all the cash from `0xbb1dbcf9F2Eb17F5C8557562d2602C3867c7C0FD`. This will fail with an error as only the owner can do a withdrawl.

```
coin.withdrawAll('0xbb1dbcf9F2Eb17F5C8557562d2602C3867c7C0FD', {from:'0xbb1dbcf9F2Eb17F5C8557562d2602C3867c7C0FD'})
```

This version of the call is insecure and can be called by ayone so will succeed and let the bad account steal all the cash.

```
coin.withdrawAllInsecure('0xbb1dbcf9F2Eb17F5C8557562d2602C3867c7C0FD', {from:'0xbb1dbcf9F2Eb17F5C8557562d2602C3867c7C0FD'})
```

Send ETH into my contract and then bounce it straight back out again to the specified address.

```
coin.sendEthToOtherContract("0x99cB5A1762CD3B68a22a32E1417bFe845A0409Bb", {value:1})
```

Send ETH from the contract's wallet to the other address. This can only be done by the contract owner.

```
coin.sendEthToOtherContractFromMe(accounts[2], 1)
```

This will fail:

```
coin.sendEthToOtherContractFromMe(accounts[2], 1, {from: accounts[2]})
```

This version of the call fails to check the owner and so can ask the wallet to send out its own cash to anyone.

```
coin.sendEthToOtherContractFromMeInsecure(accounts[2], 1, {from: accounts[2]})
```
